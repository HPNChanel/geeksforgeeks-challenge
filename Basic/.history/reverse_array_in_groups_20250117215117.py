Given an array arr of positive integers. Reverse every sub-array group of size k.

Note: If at any instance, k is greater or equal to the array size, then reverse the entire array. You shouldn't return any array, modify the given array in place.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
Explanation: First group consists of elements 1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4,5.
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 9], k = 5
Output: [9, 8, 6, 5]
Explnation: Since k is greater than array size, the entire array is reversed.
